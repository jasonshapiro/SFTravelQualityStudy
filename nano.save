Hi Jason,



So here’s how I envision the website and the items I think should go on it:



- The front page: This page will have a nice banner with UC Berkeley’s logo and 



name and the name of the study (currently the San Francisco Travel Quality 



study)



- The front page also says something along the lines of “thank you for your 



interest” and has a small amount of text that sums up the experiment in a few 



sentences. (e.g., “we want to learn how the quality of public transportation in 



San Francisco impacts the way you travel” etc.). It can also have a nice photo 



or something (make sure it’s in the public domain).



- The front page further features links (as a menu on the side, or tabs?) to the 



other items on the site. Those items are:



- A page “about the study” that has more information on it. It explains: What 



is the study about, what does it involve, and how do I sign up. I can help 



you with this content, if you are not sure what to put down, you can make 



placeholders for now.  The “how do I sign up” question simply has a link to 



the sign-up page.



- A sign-up page. We’ll have to figure out how to do this because this requires 



them taking a short survey. I quickly checked on the Qualtrics website and it 



looks like you can actually embed a survey in another website, so that could 



be an option. As part of the signup, people will need to accept the informed 



consent form.



- An “instructions for participants” page. This one is important. Can you, based 



on the material I sent you, create some easy-to-understand and concise 



instructions with some pictures/screenshots? I will forward an app apk to 



you as soon as I get one so you can work on the installation instructions. 



Basically, people need to know:



o How to install and uninstall the app (assuming they do not really 



know how to do this on Android)



o How to use the app (also the widget in case they are selected)



o How to participate in the study (i.e., how to fill out surveys, either 



when prompted or when they are on a transit trip and feel like doing 



it)



- I’d recommend creating the instructions in a way that we can also easily put 



them into a pdf and send them with the emails people will get when they sign 



up.



- We might have people in our study who have not used Muni before. It would 



be good to have a page with a few links to help them. This page can also be 



linked from the instructions page. I think the links could include:



o The SFMTA route map



o The timetable page



o NextMuni



o Google maps with some short instructions on how to get transit 



directions



- A page “The researcher team” that has a photo and short bio of me, Joan and 



Raja. I’ll supply you with a blurb. It should also have my email address for the 



study: sftravelstudy@berkeley.edu. We will add in anybody else who helps 



run the experiment when it is clearer who will be on the team.



- A page called “privacy and confidentiality”. This page should not contain 



too much information, just an explanation that we take privacy and 



confidentiality very seriously and will take every measure to protect 



participants’ data. It should then say that everything is explained in the 



Informed consent form and give a link to it.



In terms of links between the pages: The top level pages reachable from the front 



page should be:



About the study, sign-up, instructions for participants, public transit info (?), the 



research team, privacy and confidentiality. The instructions page links to the three 



(or two?) ones on installation, using the app and participating in the study.



Links between these pages should be made as makes sense.
